[Eventcrolus](http://phillipmayer.com/Eventcrolus) is a simple React app that allows you to create events with a title, start time and end time. Users can then sort events by title or date, or filter events by searching for specific words or word fragments. This app was built using Create React App, and testing was written using Jest and Enzyme.
